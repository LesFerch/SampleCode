I
started
working
in
the
anti-virus
industry
in
1989
(McAfee
Associates)
and
was
told
in
1990
that
we
were
out
of
business
because
polymorphic
computer
viruses
(e.g.
computer
viruses
that
can
randomize
their
encryption
code)
made
signature
scanning
impossible.
A
few
days
later
we
added
our
first
algorithmic
scanning
code
and
continued
on.
Needless
to
say
people
have
been
saying
"AV
is
dead"
for
various
reasons
over
the
past
~27
years
and
well
we've
been
too
busy
protecting
computers
to
notice.
For
the
past
eleven
years
I've
been
at
another
company
(ESET)
and
been
fighting
malware
authors
or
gangs
or
groups
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
them
these
days
so
from
that
perspective
it
really
doesn't
seem
that
different--or
that
long
ago--to
me.
Of
course
the
nouns
have
changed
that
is
the
types
of
threats
and
what
they
do
but
the
same
can
also
be
said
of
how
we
(the
industry)
respond
to
them.
Bona-fide
classic
computer
viruses
are
on
the
decline
typically
accounting
for
a
single
digit
percentage
of
what's
reported
on
a
daily
basis.
A
classic
computer
virus
of
course
being
defined
as
a
computer
program
that
is
recursively
self-replicating
and
it
and
its
children
can
make
(possibly
evolved)
copies
of
themselves.
I'd
also
add
that
classic
computer
viruses
are
parasitic
in
nature
which
makes
them
different
from
computer
worms
or
Trojan
horses
or
bots
or
any
of
the
other
things
that
fall
under
the
generic
umbrella
of
malware.
Most
malware
seen
on
a
daily
basis
is
non-replicating
in
nature
and
is
installed
on
a
system
through
a
vulnerability
in
the
OS
or
apps
poor
security
social
engineering
of
the
computer
operator
etc.
"Anti-virus"
software
has
evolved
over
time
just
as
the
threats
have
in
order
to
protect
users
but
it's
stilled
called
antivirus
software
for
marketing
reasons
which
I
personally
think
should
have
changed
a
while
ago
but
that's
a
bit
of
a
digression/side
rant.
Today
your
anti-malware
software
has
all
sorts
of
non-signature
technologies
in
it
to
cope
with
these
new
kinds
of
threats
(heuristics
exploit
detection
HIPS
application
firewalls
prevalency
cloud-based
etc.)
but
we've
(again
the
industry
we)
have
done
a
horrible
job
of
communicating
intelligently
to
our
customers
about
this
which
is
why
you
keep
seeing
the
whole
"AV
is
dead"
thing
popping
up
over
and
over
again
like
something
that's
er
undead.
One
of
the
best
examples
of
this
is
is
how
so-called
NGAV
("next
generation
anti
virus")
companies
have
positioned
themselves
against
established
security
companies
that
have
been
around
for
years--or
even
decades--by
saying
"AV
is
dead".
Quite
a
few
of
the
things
the
NGAVs
promote
are
things
the
established
companies
have
been
doing
but
we
never
just
talked
about
them
that
much
in
public
because
we
thought
they
were
incomprehensible
were
too
complex
for
customers
to
understand
or
most
often
were
just
another
layer
of
technology
we
use
to
protect
customers--an
important
part
at
times
but
still
only
a
component
of
a
bigger
system
used
to
protect
customers.
I
can't
take
any
credit
for
it
since
it's
from
another
security
company
(Kaspersky)
but
there's
an
article
on
their
SecureList
site
called
"Lost
in
Translation
or
the
Peculiarities
of
Cybersecurity
Tests"
that
actually
analyzed
tests
done
by
independent
third-party
testers
who
performed
the
same
tests
but
against
each
group
separately
(NGAV
programs
were
tested
against
each
other
established
programs
were
tested
against
each
other
but
the
tests
done
against
each
group
were
the
same)
and
well
in
many
of
those
tests
it
appears
the
only
thing
"next
generation"
about
some
of
those
products
is
their
marketing
of
the
whole
"AV
is
dead"
bandwagon.
One
thing
I'll
point
you
to
is
a
paper
explaining
how
ESET's
non-signature
technologies
work
which
is
available
for
download
here.
Before
I
get
yelled
at
for
shilling
I
will
point
out
that
a
lot
of
these
technologies
exist
and
are
used
by
other
companies.
The
implementation
details
and
resources
put
into
each
one
are
going
to
vary
by
company
but
the
point
is
there's
a
lot
of
things
besides
computer
viruses
and
signature
scanning
that
security
companies
are
doing
even
ones
that
have
been
around
for
a
couple
of
decades.
EDIT:
Here's
a
similar
explanation
from
F-Secure.
Thanks
whatever
stuff
